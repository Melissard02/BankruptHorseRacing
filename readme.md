# Bankrupt Horse Racing

A horse racing simulator. Use fake money to place a bet of a minimum $50 on a horse. If the horse you bet on wins, you bet your bet back and a portion of the payout. From time to time legendary horses may enter the simulation. If your horse wins against the legendary, you get an additional bonus on top of that.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Have and IDE or program to is capable of running C++ files
2. Set the executable to run on an external terminal for best layout
3. Run the exe file

Instructions for using the software:

1. Change your name in the code files, for more customization.
2. Bet on a horse before starting the race
3. Start the race simulation

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* CLion IDE or similar software
* C++
* Works best on Windows, but still operate on Mac

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Learn CPP](https://www.learncpp.com/)
* [CPlusPlus](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add player customization, change name, and income
* [ ] Implement a job paycheck system, that gives more money after a period of time
* [ ] Add an out of terminal UI for the race simulation
